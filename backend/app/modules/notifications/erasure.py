"""GDPR erasure contributor for the notifications module (#546).

Owns the ``notifications`` coverage scope: redacts this module's own
copies of the erased contacts from the communication log and reports its
own :class:`~app.core.erasure.types.ErasureCoverage`. Registered via
``NotificationsModule.get_erasure_contributors``; pulled by ``gdpr``
inside the erasure transaction (ADR 0038).
